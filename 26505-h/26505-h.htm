<span class="i0">Around which the heart-strings all tenderly twine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with sapling pole and a painted cork<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fished up and down the old Hanging Fork&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the railroad bridge, with its single span,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear down to the mill at Dawson's old dam&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When we waded the creek with our pants to the knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And got our lines tangled in a sycamore tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And were most scared to death when out from the root<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long, wriggling snake through the water did shoot,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of scenes such as these, when a bare-footed boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wandered away to the clear rippling stream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cankering care to trouble life's dream;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we spit on our bait and in whispers we'd talk,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And when I got a bite or you caught a perch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'd just give our lines a thundering lurch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And land him high up on the bank in the weeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then string him along with the pumpkin seeds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O don't you remember the hot, dusky walk,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the glassy pool is shaded by the overhanging limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pebbly bottom's glinting where the silvery minnows swim.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The tasseled corn is nodding, and the crow on drowsy wing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But they put it up at auction, and Tim Bluster bid the most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who always said "There want no hants nor any kind of ghost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever walked a graveyard in the middle of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could make <i>his</i> nerves unsteady, or could fill <i>him</i> with affright!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Tim got full possession, and he moved out to his home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first night, as he sat there, within his room alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door was softly opened, and a cat came walking in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes like balls of fire and a coat as black as sin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then squatting on its haunches, it said, in tones polite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There seems to be but two of us to stay in here to-night!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tim muttered in a trembling voice, as for the door he run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Perhaps <i>you</i> think there will be two, but darn me, there's but one!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tim staid away the blessed night, but when the daylight came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It brought him back his courage, and it filled him full of shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he said, unto himself, "There wasn't any cat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could make him leave that room again&mdash;he'd bet his life on that!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the shades of evening fell, Tim double-barred the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took precautions that, perhaps, he hadn't night before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt quite sure that nothing now could gain admittance there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peacefully he dozed and slept, a-sitting in his chair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, all at once, he roused himself, and opening wide his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld a figure standing there that made his hair arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like quills upon a porcupine, and froze his heart with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And headless though it was, it spoke, and said in accents clear,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There seems to be but two of us to stay in here to-night!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tim made a bound, and took with him the sash and every light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he jumped a nine-rail fence, and down the road he spun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Perhaps <i>he</i> thinks there's two, but darn <i>me</i>, there's but one!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas seven miles before he stopped and sat down on a log<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch his breath and rest awhile from his nocturnal jog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he turned his head around, and right before his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The figure stood, and said to him, "I think we've had a race!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tim tried to speak, and not a word he found to utter then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as he jumped from off his seat and broke away again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spluttered out, "I <i>know</i> we have, but think it's not quite done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you can bet right now's the time we'll have another one!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away Tim flew&mdash;he left the road, and through the woods and fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pace he set was wonderful, the ghost right at his heels!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that old house is tenantless, and slowly rotting down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since that dread night Tim had his dream, and moved right back to town!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">This song that I sing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It is not of a spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet of a silvery stream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But of a vision bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which came last night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the garb of a blissful dream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When I thought, as I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was Thanksgiving Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was invited to dine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where a table stood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On which everything good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread a feast that was almost divine!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Where the savors arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Right under my nose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From turkey&mdash;and pumpkin pies;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Were slices as big<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some of the campaign lies!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And celery so white<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas a thing of delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bite the crisp stalks in two.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the cranberry sauce&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, I tell you 'twas boss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flanked by an oyster stew!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">And the amber ice cream<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Melted into my dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like love to the heart of a 'poet';<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they heaped up my plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I sat there and ate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I awoke with a yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a shiver and shake<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a pain and an ache<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rudely my dream did dispel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But dreams, as you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By contraries go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus I fear if it will be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the one of delight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That came last night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I feasted so heartily;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Thanksgiving Day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the usual way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will come to me, don't you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the dinner I had<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ache that was bad<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the attic, unused, there they put it away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old oaken frame has begun to decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What iron's about it is eaten with rust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upon and around it are cobwebs and dust;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It stood on a porch where the Summer sunshine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sifted down to the floor through a clambering vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tendrils about the lattice-work clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like my heart-strings round her, and the song that she sung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pictures of fancy I con o'er and o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, raptured, I see the dear features once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrill with the touch when her lips set the seal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her love, as she spun on the old spinning-wheel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then through the shadows and mists of many long years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old cottage home to the vision appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though youth it has fled, and the hair it is gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm a bare-footed boy returned to his play&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting the present to dream once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life had no anguish, no sorrow, no pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweetly the bells of the memory peal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When communing up there with the old spinning-wheel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And back from the past, with its grief and its joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come the tones of a voice I heard when a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I see once again, as it moved to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A form that now rests where the wild roses blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sentinel stars their love vigils keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the dear one in her long, dreamless sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But memories sweet to a heart that can feel<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some spokes from the rim are broken and gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it stands there forsaken, neglected, alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It knows naught of language, but a story can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a charm that for me time cannot dispel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often I climb the old attic stair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love of my childhood with it to share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emotions possess me I cannot conceal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fondly I gaze on the old spinning-wheel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The distaff is worn and smooth with the touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the now folded hands that used it so much;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lingering there I clearly can trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet smile of love from a well-cherished face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sheds round about it a halo divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus I am kneeling at memory's shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hallows the thoughts which on the mind steal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When up there alone with the old spinning-wheel!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through the fast-welling tears that come to my eyes&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That beckons to me from the regions of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And illumines the way that my footsteps may tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unerringly where her love for me led&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the straight path that she tried to reveal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she taught me, and spun on the old spinning-wheel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, the finger of Time has furrowed the brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silvered the hair, yet I dream of her now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when, long ago, I heard as a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words of her love that my sorrows beguiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this relic she used but brings back anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning of life, that was fresh with the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distilled from the heart, as she taught me to kneel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right down by her side, and the old spinning-wheel!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here on this spot, where Nature now, with chilling, icy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has mantled in a robe of white the field of strife and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We view in memory once again the awful scenes where met<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No matter what the weather was, in good old stage coach days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The driver with his ruddy face and spanking team of bays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would spin along the turnpike road, o'er level stretch and hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wound away from "Idleburg" to classic Nicholasville.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The depths beneath his seat were filled with leathern sacks of mail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the coach's top at times was crowded to the rail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trunks, valises, packages, and bundles by the score,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That must have weighed, it seemed to me, five thousand pounds or more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And strapped within the bulging boot, that hung far out behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was added weight enough to make a team of oxen blind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And counting all the passengers that filled the coach within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The load those horses had to drag&mdash;I thought it was a sin!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How proud of them the driver was! And often he would brag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they could pull a heavier load and never balk or flag;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all the road was ankle-deep in miry, sticky mud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was the time his team would show its metal and its blood.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The "ribbons" then he'd gather up, and give his whip a crack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And any team in front of him had better clear the track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed to own the turnpike road, and kept the right of way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto himself as jealously as bloomers do to-day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By wood and field he wound along, and by the river's bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he reached the covered bridge the hoof-beats on the plank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were echoed from the cliffs around and from the vale below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And going up the hill beyond he'd let 'em walk and blow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then urged into a trot again around the curves they spun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till hove in sight the manor-house of Camp Dick Robinson;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till Nicholasville at last was reached, to them the reins he gave.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ah me! The old stage coach, abandoned now, stands in the stable lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A victim to the tooth of rust, and slow decay and rot;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And crumbled now to dust the hand that drove each gallant bay!<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear friends, to-night the inspiration of my theme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not the baseless fabric of a weird, fantastic dream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For truth, combined with justice, doth impel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore it is fact&mdash;not fiction&mdash;that I tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maxim true as holy writ;&mdash;then it is plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If rudely woven by an untaught hand it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustains but transitory wrong and injury.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus it is, in homely rhyme, I venture forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relating nothing here but under oath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if, perchance, at times it sounds a little strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know that truth o'er fiction hath a wider range.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These stanzas three I hope you'll deem explanatory&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As introductory and preliminary to the story&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A preface simply used before I introduce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proper characters essential for our use.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And just one moment more attention I will claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crave indulgence while I here explain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That "character" is used in a Pickwickian sense&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So truth and justice need not take offense.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Scarce quivered in the gentle wind, and when the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay sparkling on the grass, beneath the argent moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tragedy took place&mdash;of which I'll tell you soon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And ever and anon a fleecy, drifting cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meek Dian's face would veil with filmy shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lend to wood and field that softened ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmatched in beauty from the glaring god of day!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I will tell the story as 'twas told to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vouched for by some others&mdash;two or three&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose word to doubt would be a heinous sin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, armed with truth, in confidence I will begin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, memory! Thou art a fickle jade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft responsible when grave mistakes are made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore 'tis with caution that I hesitate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When truthful things I undertake to state.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This much is due to accuracy and circumspection,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as to a rather faulty recollection;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I'll trespass on your patience now no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But straightway tell the story&mdash;as I said before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All good beginnings have that natural trend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which safely leads to a successful end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stories all should have their plots well laid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which neither prose nor verse can do, when haste is made.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis said "procrastination is the thief of time,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this might seem to be the object of my rhyme.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Tis my sole object, then, to give without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The narrative in a direct and proper way,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But then, dear friends, the second line was <i>not</i> for you!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I only quote that you may comprehend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How modesty in <i>me</i> has missed its end,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The story that I'm going to tell&mdash;sometime to-night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An introduction that will keep the listener in suspense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I deem derogatory to good taste and sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is also why I'll nothing put as prefatory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I launch right out into the story.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm going to make it thrilling, crisp and short,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In purest diction drest, with gems of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So intermingled with the story's warp and woof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from beginning I can scarcely keep aloof.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'll put quotation marks to shrive me of the sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of plagiarism when such language I begin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every one of you may plainly see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell the story as 'twas told to me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So calmly, coolly then, I think I will proceed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give you now the story&mdash;taking heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To curtail all that truth and justice will permit&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering that "brevity's the soul of wit."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But undue haste would cause me to forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mar the memory of its telling with regret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I had overlooked some startling fact,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which on both truth and justice would re-act!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, dear friends, don't think that you are "sold"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If still as yet the story's left untold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But paper, ink, your patience, and my time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all exhausted in this race with rhyme!<br /></span>
